# StackOverview
This is just a small sample app designed to display StackOverflow questions with more then just one answer, as well as having an accepted answer.

To run, just clone or download, and run in xcode! I chose to avoid pod files to simplify the process.

Checkout this awesome combine example I found, it's the best example I could find for Combine/SwiftUI in a sample app. https://github.com/surfstudio/StackOv/tree/master/StackOv
